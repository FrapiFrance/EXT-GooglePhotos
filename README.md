# EXT-GooglePhotos
-- Extented for `MMM-GoogleAssistant` --

In end 2024, bougsounet (that created all the EXT modules for MagicMirror) deleted all his stuff from github.

In march 2025, Google closed the API.

=> this project is dead.

Take a look at https://github.com/darickc/MMM-BackgroundSlideshow/ as an alternative.

You can GoogleTakeout your photos, and serve them through MMM-BackgroundSlideshow, it will be similar to this project, except that updates from Google won't be realtime.

It allows to display photos from Google Photos album in fullscreen for `MagicMirror`

This module is an Extented plugin for `MMM-GoogleAssistant`<br>
